# Pattern Recognition

This is a machine learning project that uses Python to perform advanced pattern recognition on a dataset using a combination of different algorithms. The project uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AnjaliAshokR/Pattern-recognistion.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells. You can also open the .py file and run the script in your local environment.

## Data

The data used in this project is a image dataset.

## Model

The model used in this project are neural networks. There are three models that are ANN, CNN and SVM

## Results

The models were able to identify the patterns in the dataset with high accuracy.
