# Pattern Recognition

This is a machine learning project that uses Python to perform pattern recognition on a dataset. The project uses unsupervised learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AnjaliAshokR/Pattern-recognistion.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells. You can also open the .py file and run the script in your local environment.

## Data

The data used in this project is a image dataset.

## Model

The model used in this project are neural networks. There are three models that are ANN, CNN and SVM

## Results

The models were able to identify the patterns in the dataset with high accuracy.
